*Verify the agent level if he is in RD position he will get the commision only one level of the agent 


                      A1(RD)

              B1     B2 . . B5

IF the agent is in first level he will get the commision only B1 TO B5 agents can wirite any policy then A1 agent get 17.5% commision





                  A1

    B1 B2  ....B5
       C1 ..C10
IF B2 refer c1, c1 wirite a new policy b2 get the 17.5% of commision but A1 is still RD position he will not get any commision on c1 policy 

      Agent1(RRD)

                 A1(RD)

B1.............B3(SRD).................B5
 
               C1 (RD)...............C10



* verify the agents reach higher position than when referel person

if the A1 refers B3, but B3 reachs the SRD position A1 position is still RD in this case B3 is directly connected to another higher level position which means B3 connected to Agent1 that agent position is RRD 


Note: Tree will change only positions only will not change commision wise, commision based on level of position only.

Means: If A1 is RD he he will get one tree level commision(17.5%)

If A1 is SRD he will get two tree level commision(20%)

If A1 is RRD he will get Three level commision


* If the A1 is Rd he will get only one level of commision 

eg:    A1(RD)

* A1 recuites one person B1 then B1 worte on policies then policies commision is B1 get the 80% of commision and A1(RD) get 17.5% of commision and remaining commision is go to company pool which is 2.95% 

*100$
B1-80$
A1-17.5$
Company pool-2.95$
Total -100$



* if A1 - EVC(17.5%)
     B1 - FRC(12.5%)
     C1 - CEO(10%)
     D1 - ERD(7.5%)
     E1 - RRD(12.5%)
     F1 - SRD(20%)
     G1 - RD(17.5%)
     H1

* If H1 worte one policy A1 is evc also get some commision 

eg:  IF POLICIES COMMISION IS 100$

    if A1 - EVC(20%)-4$
     B1 - FRC(12.5%)- 2.5$
     C1 - CEO(10%)- 2
     D1 - ERD(7.5%)- 1.5$
     E1 - RRD(12.5%)-2.5$
     F1 - SRD(20%)-4$
     G1 - RD(17.5%)-3.5$  = 20$

* H1 GET 80$ ON THAT POLICY

Nagitive scenerios:

* if two agents are same level what will happend

* if one agent wrote one policy then there is no rd ,srd,rrd, only evc get 20% of the commision on that policy remaining balance company pool only.
